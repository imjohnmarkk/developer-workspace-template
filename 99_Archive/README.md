# Archive

This directory contains deprecated or rarely used files that should be preserved.

## Usage Guidelines

- **When to Archive:** Move files here when they are no longer actively used but should be kept for reference or potential future use
- **Organization:** Maintain the original folder structure when possible
- **Documentation:** Add a note explaining why the item was archived and when

## Best Practices

- Include a date in the folder name when archiving (e.g., `ProjectName_2023-06`)
- Add an `ARCHIVED.md` file to each archived item explaining:
  - Why it was archived
  - When it was archived
  - Any special notes for future reference
  - Where to find related active projects (if applicable)
- Consider compressing large folders before archiving
- Periodically review archived items to determine if they should be:
  - Restored to active use
  - Permanently deleted
  - Continued in archive

## Retrieval

If you need to retrieve something from the archive:

1. Copy (don't move) the item to its appropriate active directory
2. Update any dependencies or references
3. Test thoroughly before relying on archived code
4. Consider whether the retrieved item should replace its archived version
