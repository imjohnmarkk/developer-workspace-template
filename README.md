## Usage Guidelines

1. Place new projects in `00_Projects/Active/`
2. Move completed projects to `00_Projects/Archived/`
3. Store reusable code in `02_Snippets/` organized by language
4. Use templates from `03_Templates_Starters/` to kickstart new projects
5. Document important information in `05_Notes/`
6. Keep all assets organized in `06_Assets/`

## Best Practices

- Maintain consistent naming conventions within each directory
- Add README files to individual projects
- Regularly clean up and archive unused files
- Use version control for active projects
