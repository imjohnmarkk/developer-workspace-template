# Developer Workspace Template

An organized directory structure for developers of all experience levels, from beginners to professionals.

## Getting Started

### For Beginners
1. Start with the `01_Learning` directory to build your skills
2. Use the `00_Projects/Playground` folder for experimenting with code
3. Check `05_Notes/Cheatsheets` for quick reference guides
4. Try modifying templates in `03_Templates_Starters` for practice

### For Intermediate Developers
1. Store your ongoing projects in `00_Projects/Active`
2. Build a collection of reusable code in `02_Snippets`
3. Document your learning in `05_Notes/Concepts`
4. Customize your development environment in `04_Tools/Dev_Setup`

### For Professional Developers
1. Maintain a portfolio in `00_Projects/Showcase`
2. Create advanced templates in `03_Templates_Starters`
3. Develop custom tools in `04_Tools/Personal_Tools`
4. Use version control for all projects

## Usage Guidelines

1. Place new projects in `00_Projects/Active/`
2. Move completed projects to `00_Projects/Archived/`
3. Store reusable code in `02_Snippets/` organized by language
4. Use templates from `03_Templates_Starters/` to kickstart new projects
5. Document important information in `05_Notes/`
6. Keep all assets organized in `06_Assets/`
7. Beginners should start with `01_Learning` and `00_Projects/Playground`

## Best Practices

- Maintain consistent naming conventions within each directory
- Add README files to individual projects
- Regularly clean up and archive unused files
- Use version control for active projects
- Document your code with comments that explain "why" not just "what"
- Create a `.gitignore` file in each project to exclude unnecessary files
