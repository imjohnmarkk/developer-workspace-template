4. Use templates from `03_Templates_Starters/` to kickstart new projects
5. Document important information in `05_Notes/`
6. Keep all assets organized in `06_Assets/`
7. Beginners should start with `01_Learning` and `00_Projects/Playground`

## ✨ Best Practices

- Maintain consistent naming conventions within each directory
- Add README files to individual projects
- Regularly clean up and archive unused files
- Use version control for active projects
- Document your code with comments that explain "why" not just "what"
- Create a `.gitignore` file in each project to exclude unnecessary files

## 🔄 Version Control

- Initialize Git in project directories with `git init`
- Use meaningful commit messages that explain changes
- Create branches for new features or experiments
- Consider using Git hooks for automation (see `04_Tools/Git_Helpers`)
- Follow a consistent branching strategy

## 🛡️ Security

- Never commit sensitive credentials or API keys
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated
