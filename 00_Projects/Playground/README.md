# Playground

A safe space for experimentation and learning without affecting production code.

## Purpose

The Playground directory is designed for:
- Experimenting with new languages or frameworks
- Testing concepts without creating formal projects
- Learning through trial and error
- Sandbox environments for risk-free coding

## How to Use

1. Create subdirectories for different experiments or technologies
2. Don't worry about perfect code - this is a space to learn and make mistakes
3. Document interesting discoveries or learnings
4. Move successful experiments to proper projects when ready

## Best Practices

- Date your experiments (e.g., `react_hooks_2023-06-15`)
- Include notes about what you're trying to learn
- Don't be afraid to break things - that's how learning happens
- Clean up periodically, moving valuable code to snippets or projects
