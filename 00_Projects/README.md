# Projects

This directory contains all your coding projects organized by their current status.

## Subdirectories

### Active

Store all your ongoing projects here. Each project should have its own folder with a descriptive name.

**Usage:**

- Create a new folder for each project
- Include a README.md in each project folder describing its purpose and setup
- Use version control (Git) for each active project

### Archived

Move completed or paused projects here to keep your Active directory clean.

**Usage:**

- Archive projects that are completed or no longer in active development
- Maintain the same folder structure as in Active
- Add a note in the project's README about why it was archived and when

### Showcase

Place your best projects here for portfolio purposes.

**Usage:**

- Only include polished, complete projects
- Ensure comprehensive documentation
- Consider adding screenshots or demos
- Make sure the code is clean and well-commented
