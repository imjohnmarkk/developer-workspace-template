# Snippets

This directory contains reusable code snippets organized by programming language.

## Subdirectories

### JS

JavaScript code snippets.

**Usage:**

- Name files descriptively (e.g., `array_manipulation.js`, `dom_helpers.js`)
- Include comments explaining what each snippet does
- Add usage examples in comments
- Consider categorizing into subfolders for complex collections

### Python

Python code snippets.

**Usage:**

- Name files by functionality (e.g., `file_operations.py`, `data_processing.py`)
- Document parameters and return values
- Include example usage
- Consider using docstrings for documentation

### Shell

Shell and bash script snippets.

- Make scripts executable when appropriate
- Document any required permissions or dependencies

## Best Practices

- Keep snippets small and focused on a single task
- Include proper documentation and usage examples
- Test snippets before adding them
- Add attribution if the snippet comes from an external source
- Consider adding tags or categories in comments for easier searching
